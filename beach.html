            <p class="card-text text-light fs-4" >With its sun-kissed sands, turquoise waters, secluded coves and vibrant coastal culture, the beaches of God’s Own Country sings a different song to every traveller who seeks its shores.Kerala, the southernmost state of India shares around 600km of shoreline with the Arabian Sea. Thus it hosts some of the fascinating beaches in India. The shoreline topography is peculiar and changes promptly as one proceeds from north to south. Places such as Bekal, Kannur, Muzhapilangad, and Thalassery in the north Kerala exhibit rise of headlands above the shore from the marginal of the beaches. Beaches from Kozhikode to the south of Kerala display flat lands with rocky extensions projecting out. However, Kerala is known for its serene beauty of coconut trees-lined beaches, rivers, backwaters, and a network of canals throughout its terrain.</p>
